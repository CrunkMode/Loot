==========================
Grand list of things to do
==========================

-Figure out the "Invisible potion" bug

-Interactable list for NPCs

-General HUD implementations

-Inventory screen can select hidden item at end of list 
(related to invis potion bug)

-It's clear to me that I need to reformat the entire way the NPC's 
inventory system works I already created a system to print out and
have the player select whatever is in their inventory, if I can somehow
modify that method i take in any inventory I can hook 
it into the NPC barter menu.

-Figure out a way to make an exponential (Is that the right word?) 
system for experience gain. Still getiing 50 EXP for killing a dragon while
you've grinded to level 10 is not very fun.
